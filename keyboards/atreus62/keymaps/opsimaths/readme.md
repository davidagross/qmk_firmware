# Generated Keymap Layout, based on Mfluid Keymap Mod for the Atreus62

This layout was generated by the QMK API. You can find the JSON data used to
generate this keymap in the file layers.json.

## Changelog
This fork was mainly to fix the `KC_LSPO`/`KC_RSPC` clash--the board goes into a weird state if one is pushed while the other is held.

All that was required was addressing the [caveat](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/features/feature_space_cadet_shift#caveats) for Space Cadet Shift.

Now, this isn't even used due to the final keycap arrangement.
