# Mfluid Keymap Mod for the Atreus62

## Changelog

This fork is mainly to fix the `KC_LSPO`/`KC_RSPC` clash--the board goes into a weird state if one is pushed while the other is held.

All that's required is the addressing the [caveat](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/features/feature_space_cadet_shift#caveats) for Space Cadet Shift.
