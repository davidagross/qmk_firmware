# Minidox Layout by dgroseph

This is a QWERTY minidox training layout merging my favorite features of [tw1t611](../tw1t611) and [oprietop](../oprietop).

## Layers
| Layer | Legend |
| ----- | ------ |
| Base  | Middle (Bottom Middle for Momentary Hold) |
| Lower | Bottom Right |
| Raise | Top Right |
| Adjust | Front print |

## Features
* Raise/lower layers focus one-handed use
* Numpad on right hand with lower layers
* SDFG (raised) and DXCV (lowered) movement for mixed-handed commands

## TODOs
* Some tap-dance or momentary layer magic to get an apostrophe easily for contractions
  * like double tapping "n", "I", or "e" to put an apostrophe after them
  * or having the "t" on the "n" layer print "n't", etc.
* have a full movement layer like [oprietop](../oprietop) to make room for moar 5tuff
* follow [dustypomerleau](../dustypomerleau) for even moar symmetry and momentary commands in the home row
